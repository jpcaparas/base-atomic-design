## Requirements
- Node.js > 6.3.0 (`brew install node`)
- NPM > 3.10.0 (installed as part of Node.js)
- Yarn > 0.16.0 (`npm install -g yarn`)

## Installing

Run `yarn install` to install the project.

## Running

Run `yarn run watch` to watch and compile the Javascript and SCSS files. The project uses:

- Babel, to provide ES6 support.
- PostCSS, to allow us to use:
    - Autoprefixer, to take care of those pesky prefixes...which are [being phased out](https://webkit.org/blog/6131/updating-our-prefixing-policy/)!
- Jest, to handle Unit testing of the Javascript.

## Linting

To run both linters, use the following command:

	yarn run lint

To just run the Javascript linter:

	yarn run lint-js

To just run the SASS/CSS linter:

	yarn run lint-scss

## Testing

To run the Jest unit tests, use the following command:

	yarn test

## Browser Support

Supported and tested in the following browsers:

- Internet Explorer (10-11)
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari 9
- Edge 14

## Polyfills

- [SVG4Everybody](https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody) - Adds the ability to implement `<use></use>` SVG element in older browsers (IE10), for use with external SVG loading.

## Gotchas

- Always set width and height on <svg> elements which implement external `<use>` elements, otherwise Internet Explorer does not display them.

## Inspiration

Our base HTML is inspired by:

- [HTML5Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
